----
 * Fixed:   LinReaper can once again download the latest version of Reaper
            and works with the newer versions of Wine lacking wineprefixcreate.
 * Updated: wineasio updated to version 0.8.0.

0.83
----
 * Fixed:   LinReaper now works even if there are no versions of Reaper
            available for download.

0.82
----
 * New:     The LinReaper VSTTool has been replaced by a new multi-tool.
            The new tool is available from the menu as
            "LinReaper Options".
            From there you can manage both your VST and JS effects,
            run Reaper with the options normally installed as extra
            menu shortcuts on Windows and configure and manage LinReapers
            Wine installation.
 * Fixed:   Running Reaper from commandline with filenames containing
            spaces now works.

0.81
----
 * New:     If DLL registration of WineAsio fails locally, LinReaper will
            give the option to install WineAsio to /usr/lib/wine instead.

0.80
----
 * Changed: Cleaned up the config dir and Wine setup handling a lot.
 * New:     LinReaper will now link the Wine dirs Desktop, My Documents
            My Pictures and My Videos to either similar named dirs in
            the users home dir, the XDG USER DIR settings or simply
            to the users home dir if none of the above exists.
 * New:     The config dir is now named the same as the installation
            directory. This means that you can install several versions
            of Reaper, each with their own config, as long as you name
            the install dirs differently.
 * New:     You can now give a reaper install exe as an argument to
            LinReaper.

0.72
----
 * New:     A new tool called LinReaper VST Tool is now included!
            Its function is to aid in installing and maintaining Windows
            VSTs in your Reaper installation.
 * Changed: Reaper is now configured to use $HOME/.config/reaper/vst and 
            /usr/lib/vstwin32 as the default paths for Windows VSTs.
            $HOME/.vst still works, but really should be used for native
            Linux VSTs.

            blunder was once again caught by Rick Stone.

0.68
----
 * Fixed:   Not all installations have a $HOME/.local/share - LinReaper will
            now create it if missing. Once again, thanks to Rick Stone.

0.67
----
 * Fixed:   The installer now again actually works on other systems than
            my own, thanks to Rick Stone on the Reaper forum.

----
 * New:     LinReaper now uses the Wine registry to locate Windows paths.
            This ensures that LinReaper will work on different locales.

            internet connection is found

            configuration (meaning faster graphics)
